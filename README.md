# folderscan
Windows script to scan a list of folders for older unused files. Within the chosen folders, files that have not been created, modified, or accessed for a set number of days, will be recycled/deleted.

Intended to occasionally clear out folders full of crap, such as a Download folder. Inspired by, but not based on, a feature of Belvedere.

Written haphazardly in Autoit. Not tested anywhere near enough yet. May not work, probably buggy as hell.
